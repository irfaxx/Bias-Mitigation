**Instructions**

Setup: Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the required libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.

Dataset: Make sure to have the dataset (creditworthiness.csv) in the same directory as the Python script.

Run the Script: Execute the Python script bias_mitigation_methods.py. This script contains implementations of various bias mitigation methods along with explanations and evaluations.

Review Results: After running the script, review the output and visualizations generated. The script provides insights into the effectiveness of each bias mitigation method applied to the dataset.


**Bias Mitigation Methods**


Preprocessing: Detects and removes bias from training data before model training. Advantages include early intervention, transparency, and domain flexibility.

In-processing: Integrates bias mitigation directly into the model training process. It allows for fine-tuning fairness metrics during training but might be model-dependent and require careful hyperparameter tuning.

Post-processing: Bias mitigation occurs after model training. It's flexible and applicable to pre-existing models but may lack integration with the model development process and require manual intervention.

Reweighting: Adjusts instance weights to mitigate bias in the training data. It calculates various fairness metrics before and after reweighting to evaluate its effectiveness.

Gerry Fair: Utilizes the GerryFairClassifier to train a fair model. It addresses statistical parity difference, disparate impact, and smoothed empirical differential fairness.

Equalized Odds Postprocessing (EPP): A post-processing method that aims to ensure equalized odds in model predictions. It adjusts predictions to achieve fairness metrics such as statistical parity difference, disparate impact, and smoothed empirical differential fairness.

**Conclusion**

The effectiveness of bias mitigation methods depends on various factors, including dataset characteristics, model complexity, and fairness considerations. This repository provides a starting point for understanding and implementing bias mitigation techniques in machine learning workflows.
